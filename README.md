# D&D BECMI Errata

Here I collect the "official" dragon magazine errata and sage advice column from Dragon Magazine for D&D BECMI.
Those were the most "official" errata in a world pre-internet that existed in 80s and 90s. Many of there errata were used in international releases of the game (checked on an italian version).
